<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://github.com/lozanasc-archives/Learning-Management-System/blob/main/sample/Sample.png?raw=true)  

I was experimenting with the DOM with this one, trying to make a Learning Management System with just pure VanillaJS it can be achieved 
but its very tiring and you have hardcode a lot of stuff, my mistake here is that I didn't utilize the history API to work with my CSR-ish approach with VanillaJS. This project is not in any way usable aside from the Login and Registration but as for the Dashboard

### Built With

* [VanillaJS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
